# Safe domain primitives

This repository was inspired by talk of [@DanielSawano](https://twitter.com/DanielSawano) about writing secure software [[link]](https://www.slideshare.net/sawano/devoxx-pl-2017-cracking-the-code-to-secure-software).

This projects focuses on concept of domain primitives.
I started collecting use cases for generic domain primitives and implementig them.
